# MatrixFaceImageView
Create the matrix faces animation

## Inspiration 
This project is inspired by [matrix-faces](https://github.com/servetgulnaroglu/matrix-faces).
Since I could not find a Swift implementation online. I coded it as a fun exercise.

## Implementation 

 - Spawn UIViews with a CATextLayer (slighly more performant the using UILabels)
 - CADisplayLink updates the positions of the spawned view and sets the opacity based on the luminescence of a pixel
